siykim@uiowa.edu / 765-409-9692
University of Iowa, Tipple College of Business; majoring in Business Analytics & Information Systems.
Senior, graduating in Fall 2019.

I am a self-motivated and proactive person who challenges any goal-driven environment. I have a big desire to learn more about data science and how it is applied in the real business field. I strongly believe data analysis ability is an essential way to draw meaningful conclusions in the era of huge data and information. I would love to have an opportunity to share my experiences, skills, and goals with people with similar interests.

After I graduate, I am looking forward to working as a Business / Data Analyst where I can contribute my knowledge with the highest quality and simultaneously develop it by working on influential and worthwhile projects.
